MISSING NATIVE LIBRARIES FOR DINKOTPDF
======================================

The following native libraries are required for DinkToPdf (HTML to PDF conversion) to work:

Required files:
- x64\libwkhtmltox.dll (for 64-bit systems)
- x86\libwkhtmltox.dll (for 32-bit systems)

Download from: https://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html
1. Download "wkhtmltopdf 0.12.6 (with patched qt)" for Windows
2. Extract libwkhtmltox.dll from the installation
3. Place in the appropriate architecture folder (x64 or x86)

Alternative: Copy from a previous working build or from another DinkToPdf project.

The application will not be able to convert HTML to PDF without these libraries.
